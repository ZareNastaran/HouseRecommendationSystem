" Yin / Yang: Two halves, dark and light. Opposite forces, interconnecting and counterbalancing, that together complete wholeness. Cosmic duality. Designed by Andre Tchelistcheff Architects, and exquisitely executed using the highest quality finishes and materials, this floor-through loft has been beautifully transformed into two connected but distinct spaces, with separate entrances for maximum live/work functionality. In front, a bright and open, 50ft wide living space with one bedroom and full bathroom (easily convertible to two bedrooms); in the rear, a large, high-ceilinged studio/entertainment/work space with its own full bathroom and wet bar. While the studio is designed for maximum practicality and durability, the apartment in front is designed with warmer, more delicate finishes and fixtures. Yin and Yang. Entering off a key-locked elevator vestibule into the front living space, one is immediately enveloped in sumptuous custom wood millwork. 5-inch wide white oak planks line the floor and ceiling. Gorgeous teak cabinetry and closets wrap a large open kitchen, accented with natural Luce di Luna quartzite counters and backsplash, and top-of-the-line stainless steel appliances. Teak is also used for a custom built-in media console and large double-panel pocket doors for the master bedroom. The master bathroom is draped in elegant Imperial Danby honed marble, outfitted with teak cabinetry and polished nickel fixtures, and features a two-person glass enclosed shower, his-and-hers sinks, along with a bidet. The 12ft high beamed ceiling and a 50ft span of oversized, double-hung thermopane windows allows for superb northern light to fill this voluminous loft all day. Truly a harmonious and tranquil respite from bustling Fifth Avenue. Off the kitchen, brushed stainless steel double doors, softened with a satin wax sealant, give way to a more industrial expression in the rear studio/entertaining/work. Newly patched and repaired, original maple floors stained a rich brown anchor the studio's four walls of black, white, glass and salmon-toned brick. Richlite - an extremely robust, matte-black, paper-based composite - was used to line the expansive floor-to-ceiling closets, cabinets, wet bar and bathroom entry. Factory-style casement windows span the full width of the south wall, with a fire balcony beyond, and a wonderfully textured exposed brick wall lends a very industrial feel to this open space. The wet bar includes a sink, fridge, dishwasher and microwave, and the full bathroom features a shower lined with Ann Sacks Savoy tile and outfitted with polished nickel fixtures.

" ***FIRST OPEN HOUSE - SUNDAY JAN 26TH 12:30PM-1:30PM*** Few words can describe the level of enchantment one feels upon entering Residence 1002 on Bergen St. Absolutely no stone has been left unturned within the confines of this masterfully renovated townhome, or outside of it. From the moment your clockwise rotation of the doorknob ends and the front door is slowly swayed open, it'll be impossible to not become wide-eyed from the unexpectedly high cathedral-like ceilings. Still in disbelief from the ceiling height, curiosity slowly leads you through the sizable living room of this owner's triplex towards the sun-drenched kitchen in the far end of the parlor floor. As you make your way, your eyes can't help but be drawn to your right to enjoy close up visuals of the stunning walnut banisters which houses each meticulously placed stem of the custom single knuckle followed by double knuckle iron balusters. Simply stunning! By this time you're gracefully entering the eat-in kitchen eager to glide your hands across the top of the Imported Calcutta marble kitchen island that's beautifully coupled with Signature Hardware's stainless steel faucet and sink. The stainless steel appliances collection includes the Italian made 36 inch Z Line Dual Fuel gas range, ZLine 1200 CFM range hood with external ventilation, 36' wide width Samsung refrigerator and dishwasher. Natural light pours in through the wall of floor to ceiling Pella kitchen windows which also doubles as the doors to the patio and garden. The expansive depth of the garden area is approximately 69 feet. Now it's off to the Majestic Master Suite level. As you take the final step at the top of the stairs you're greeted by the entryway of a voluminous master bedroom that's overloaded with sunlight. Even though the Master bedroom is sizable enough to fit two king size beds, side tables and an armoire with matching dresser, that won't be necessary. Especially since this Master Suite is outfitted with a passthrough walk-in closet the size of a guest bedroom complete with meticulously designed built-ins. Just when you thought your admiration for Residence 1002 was at its ultimate height you peer through the exit of the closet to become overwhelmed by a glimpse of one of the most astonishing townhouse bathrooms your have ever laid your eyes on.

" Introducing history, location and opportunity at the Pierce School Lofts-spectacular-spectacular! There is nothing like this in all of Washington, DC! Walk into the long and rich history of this 1893 renowned German-born architect- Adolf Cluss designed penthouse part of the historic Pierce School condo conversion of 2012. Serving as the alma mater to eight decades of DC children this breathtaking home offers the perfect marriage of classical and modern in its meticulous design. Built in 1893, the building itself is very much in the Cluss architectural spirit, who was responsible for the design of more than ninety late 19th and early 20th centuries structures in Washington, DC, a number of which were public schools like the Pierce School. A notable example of his commercial work is the nearby Eastern Market, designed in 1873. Like most large-scale buildings of its time, the Pierce School was constructed entirely of red brick.With existing schoolhouse features, its depth of character and aesthetic design is very much anchored in the architecture of its time. This unit provides open and airy spaces, plenty of room for guests and exceptional entertaining just to name a few of the amazing features of this home. This penthouse is packed with personality, color, texture, and layers that make this space entrancing and luxuriating in a sense of grandeur.As renovations began on the schoolhouse, the developers knew that the top two floors presented an incredible opportunity to create something wholly original in the space, and the result is 9,800 square feet ~ the largest penthouse in DC. Ceilings stretch over 30 feet high in some areas, and original components from the schoolhouse such as chalkboards and locker cubbies have been incorporated into the final design throughout the building and the unit. In addition, this penthouse offers exposed brick, sleek lines, and classic elements. Industrial elements like the stunning metal staircase in the main living room perfectly meld together the classic and the modern. Features include: 9,800 Sq. ft. penthouse with city views; A true loft conversion; 2-story 40-foot lofted living room; 5 Bedrooms; 4 Full and one half baths; 20 ft. kitchen island; Original hardwood floors; Private roof deck patio offering panoramic views; Private theatre with seatingBuilding Amenities: full gym, black bottom swimming pool & hot tubFor the investment minded, the opportunity exists to create a second unit!

" Most shop for a house to buy mainly based on the look, location and price. They ignore the quality of the heating, cooling, plumbing and ventilation, which will eternally determine the quality of the air they breathe, water they use for drinking, cooking, and washing foods, and the energy and water bills they pay. To maximize the salability, the owners employ the house components that are seductively visible. Being mesmerized, home hunters fall for the look. Consumers get what they want and providers make tons of money. But, is it good for the consumers in the long run? IF MORE IS SPENT FOR THE IMPRESSIVE LOOK, LESS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR EVERYTHING ELSE. MOST ITEMS INSTALLED TO ACHIEVE THE IMPRESSIVE LOOK, COME SILENTLY AND WITHOUT AN INVITATION, HARMFUL OFF-GASES, SLOWLY EMITTED FOR YEARS. If you plan to live in the house for a few days, it may not matter, but, if you plan to stay for years, it is everything. Radon, formaldehyde, and other toxic chemicals that you and your family are unknowingly exposed to, can hurt. At concentrations low as PPB (parts per billion, an equivalence of seconds in 31.7 years), chemicals in the air, water and foods may be invisible, tasteless, and odorless. THEY DO NOT KILL OVERNIGHT, BUT PROLONG REPEATED EXPOSURE CAN LEAD TO CANCERS, SLEEP AND SEXUAL DISORDERS, CHRONIC ACHES AND PAINS, PREMATURE AGING, AND ABNORMAL FETAL DEVELOPMENT! Fetuses, infants, and seniors are more vulnerable because their livers, either have not fully developed, or are too old and weak for the task. If in doubt, Google for endocrine disruptors, xenobiotics, epigenetics, environmental toxicants, etc. In most houses, the energy bills can go through the roofs while the occupants freeze in winters, and sweat in summers. Upstairs are too hot while downstairs too cold. MOST HOUSES ADVERTISED FOR SALE OR RENT GIVE FEW DETAILS. WHY? THE LANDLORDS CANNOT BRAG ON THE GOOD THINGS THEY DO NOT HAVE! Choosing a wrong house can cost you much more than high energy and water bills. Your health is on the line too. Unlike other houses, this TechwiseHome has been upgraded by a House Scientist to give you: (1) Cleaner Breathing Air - Even furniture needs little dusting; (2) Purified Water without the Bottles, for Drinking, Cooking, and Washing Foods; (3) Super Heating and Cooling System Upgraded to OUTPERFORM THOSE IN OTHER HOUSES, IN COMFORT AND OPERATIONAL COSTS. The upstairs and downstairs temperatures differ little. Unlike other houses, it heats and cools so fast and efficiently that you can turn the thermostat off when nobody is home, to save energy and money, and turn it back on ONLY when needed and within minutes, you can feel comfortable! Other houses take almost forever to be comfortable. (4) Powerful Ventilator Engineered to Create Beach-like Breezes on your command. It helps you get by comfortably with little air conditioning.

Some owner financing of down payment available upon approved credit and review. Will CO-OP with brokers. The $10,000 figure is about what you would need as a down payment, so, if you do not have $10,000 available, you are probably not ready to purchase these properties. Lastly, tenants currently do not know I'm selling the properties and would ask that you keep this confidential. If you are interested, you can drive by the units but please do not approach the homes or the tenants. I will schedule showing so the inside can be seen and inspected by serious buyers. 443-445 Wrexham Ave. Columbus 43223 - 3 bedroom, 2 full baths, Great room, dining, kitchen and a full basement with W/D hookup.
